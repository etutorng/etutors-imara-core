# Project Imara 🌿

> "Digital Life Support for the Girl Child."

**Project Imara** (derived from the root for Strength and Firmness) is an Open Source humanitarian platform designed to provide underserved young women in rural Nigeria with a holistic empowerment ecosystem.

Unlike traditional EdTech platforms, Imara removes all barriers to entry (no email required, offline-first) to deliver tangible life-saving and life-changing services directly to the most vulnerable.

## 🚀 The Core Pillars

Project Imara is built on four non-negotiable pillars of empowerment:

- **⚖️ Legal Protection:** Anonymous reporting tools connecting victims of abuse to pro-bono legal partners.
- **🛠️ Economic Independence:** Video-based vocational training (Fashion, Tech, Agriculture) optimized for low-bandwidth networks.
- **🤝 Mentorship:** A safe, verified "Councillor" system connecting girls to female role models.
- **🏥 Health & Wellness:** Culturally sensitive health education in local languages.

## 🌍 Accessibility First (The "Rural Amina" Standard)

We architected this platform for "Rural Amina"—a 16-year-old girl in a village with a shared Android phone and poor internet.

- **Zero Friction Auth:** Sign up with Phone Number Only. No email required.
- **Self-Attestation:** No ID uploads required. We trust women to be women.
- **Offline-First:** Built as a PWA. Videos and content can be downloaded once and viewed offline forever.
- **Multilingual Engine:** Full UI and Content support for English, Hausa, Igbo, Yoruba, and Pidgin.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (via Drizzle ORM)
- **Authentication:** Better-Auth (Phone-based)
- **State/Cache:** TanStack Query (Offline persistence)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment:** Vercel / Docker (Self-Hostable)
